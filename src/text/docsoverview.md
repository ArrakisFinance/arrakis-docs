# About Arrakis Documentation

Welcome to the Arrakis documentation. 

Whether you're a developer, liquidity provider, treasury manager, DeFi enjoyooor or an MEV enthusiast, we aim to make this reference guide useful and interesting.

The documentation is structured into three main sections:
- [Intro to Arrakis](introduction/introduction.md)
- [Developer Docs](arrakisModular/overview.md)
- [Resources](resources.md)

[Intro to Arrakis](introduction/introduction.md) is a non-technical tl;dr of the problem we're solving, the Arrakis infrastructure, integrations and user-facing products. 

[Developer Docs](arrakisModular/overview.md) covers smart contract architecture, how to get started guides, an extensive technical reference and more. It also includes module integrations such as HOT AMM. It is aimed at developers interested in understanding the inner workings of Arrakis who are already familiar with Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem. 

[Resources](resources.md) contains links to smart contract audits, our research and legacy documentation for Arrakis v1 & v2.
