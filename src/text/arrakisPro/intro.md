# Arrakis Pro Docs

Here you can learn about the feature set and technical details of Arrakis Pro. What is Arrakis Pro? See the [high-level intro](../../text/introduction/arrakisPro.md)

Arrakis Pro is built on **_Arrakis Modular Private Meta Vaults_**.  Dive into [Arrakis Modular Docs](../../text/arrakisModular/overview.md) to learn about Arrakis Modular smart contracts in-depth.

### TLDR

A **_Private Meta Vault_** can be thought of as the entrypoint and heads-up display for a single LP to manage their onchain DEX liquidity on a token pair (e.g. ETH/AAVE) in a sophisticated and optimized way. Private Vault ownership is tokenized as an NFT, similar to Uniswap V3 NFTs (pictured below)

_Arrakis Pro Vaults_ are a subset of _Private Meta Vaults_ configured to use Arrakis' proprietary Offchain Management Infrastructure and Liquidity Provision Strategy Templates.

**WARNING: IF YOU TRANSFER A PRIVATE VAULT NFT YOU ALSO TRANSFER THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE UNDERLYING FUNDS** (exactly like Uni V3 NFTs)
