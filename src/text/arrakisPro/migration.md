# Migration

If you have an Arrakis PALM vault and want to update to the new Arrakis Pro system, contact us.

For now migrations are limited to Uniswap V3 (legacy palm vault) -> Uniswap V4 (pro vault). Because new pro vaults are modular, one could do the migration to Uni V4 and then move to a different module from there.

Migrations, once configured by Arrakis engineers, can be performed seamlessly on the Arrakis Pro UI (via Safe Custom App, for Safe users)

NOTE: because it is a sensitive operations, the migration must be executed within a few minutes of payload generation. Make sure you have signers ready to sign when you are going through migration flow.
