# HOT AMM Overview

### TL;DR

LPs are getting rekt by toxic order flow. HOT improves returns and maximizes capital efficiency for LPs, by internalizing MEV using an intent-based design.

HOT was designed by Arrakis and Valantis Labs. It is built on the [Valantis Modular DEX Framework](https://docs.valantis.xyz/). HOT is the first integration on Arrakis Modular and is powered by Arrakis's offchain market making infrastructure.
