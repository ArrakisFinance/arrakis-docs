# Permissionless AMM

In this section we describe the main actions that users can perform on the permissionless side of HOT AMM. We divide these actions into two sets:

- [Add Liquidty](addLiquidity.md) and [Remove Liquidity](removeLiquidity.md): For Liquidity Providers that want to fuel HOT AMM and earn from trading fees and incentives.
- [Swap](swap.md): For retail users and aggregators that desire to swap with low fees and up-to-date prices.

For AMM swaps, the swap context should be left completely empty. The rest of the swap params can be set according to the userâ€™s order.

Example AMM Swap Params

```solidity
    SovereignPoolSwapContextData memory data;
    SovereignPoolSwapParams memory params = SovereignPoolSwapParams({
        isSwapCallback: false,
        isZeroToOne: true,
        amountIn: 1e18,
        amountOutMin: 0,
        deadline: block.timestamp + 2,
        recipient: address(this),
        swapTokenOut: address(token1),
        swapContext: data
    });

    pool.swap(params);
```
