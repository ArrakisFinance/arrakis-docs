# Permissionless AMM

Here we describe the main actions that users can perform on the permissionless side of HOT AMM.

- [Add Liquidty](../../../arrakisModular/guides/quickstart/addLiquidity.md) and [Remove Liquidity](../../../arrakisModular/guides/quickstart/removeLiquidity.md): For Liquidity Providers that want to fuel HOT AMM and earn from trading fees and incentives. We refer to the Arrakis Modular guide for public vaults interactions.
- [Swap](https://docs.valantis.xyz/hot/swap/amm-swap): For retail users and aggregators that desire to swap with low fees and up-to-date prices. These swaps happen against a single concentrated liquidity position, according to a UniswapV3 like constant-product AMM (CPAMM) logic. For more details, we refer to the [Valantis Sovereign Pool documentation](https://docs.valantis.xyz/sovereign-pool-subpages/sovereign-pool-actions/swap-steps).
