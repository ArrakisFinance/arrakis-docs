# Quickstart HOT AMM

### Solvers

Are you a solver looking to integrate HOT AMM liquidity pools as a liquidity source? Please refer to the [Valantis Solver Guide](https://docs.valantis.xyz/hot/solver-guide-subpages).

### Permissionless AMM Users

HOT AMM functions as a permissionless onchain liquidity pool very similar to Uniswap V3 pools.

- [Provide Liquidity](../../../text/arrakisModular/quickstart.md): see this guide for interacting with HOT AMM as a liquidity provider.

- [Swap](https://docs.valantis.xyz/hot/swap/amm-swap): for retail users and aggregators that desire to swap with low fees and up-to-date prices. These swaps happen against a single concentrated liquidity position, according to a UniswapV3 like constant-product AMM logic. For more details, we refer to the [Valantis Sovereign Pool documentation](https://docs.valantis.xyz/sovereign-pool-subpages/sovereign-pool-actions/swap-steps).
