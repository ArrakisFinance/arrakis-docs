# HOT AMM (Valantis) module

Public Vault and Private Vault module integrations with the Valantis HOT AMM.

HOT AMM is a hybrid AMM / RFQ based experimental liquidity pool contract.

The HOT AMM module was used for our first ever Arrakis Modular Public Vault experiment on ETH/USDC mainnet pair. THough recently deprecated, you can read more about it [here](../../text/modules/hotAmm/overview.md)

NOTE: To create and activate this module requires coordination with both valantis and arrakis teams to deploy the AMM pool specifically for the Arrakis Vault of interest (whether public or private).

## Deployments

Networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum
