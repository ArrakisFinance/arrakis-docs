# Smart Contract Framework (Arrakis Modular)

Arrakis Modular represents the next evolution of the Arrakis onchain liquidity management smart contracts. Arrakis Modular introduces a universal Meta-Vault standard, which standardizes the interface for integration any two-sided liquidity provision protocol. Arrakis Modular is highly flexible, reusable and scalable:

- **Flexibility**: Modules adhering to a common interface can be easily developed and attached, supporting a broad range of DEXs and use-cases.
- **Reusability**: The Arrakis Vault standard facilitates the reuse of components and maintenance of standard interfaces, streamlining future expansions.
- **Scalability**: Adapting to new liquidity pool types becomes straightforward, focusing on module development rather than protocol overhauls.
