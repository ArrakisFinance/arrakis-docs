# Problem statement

- Sophisticated actors extract value known as MEV from Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem every day. These actors profit from MEV extraction at retail’s expense.
- Searchers extract MEV through strategies like sandwich attacks and arbitrage while builders and proposers also profit. Due to MEV, LPs are getting marginalized on AMMs.
- Arrakis is focused on solving the MEV problem for LPs by building onchain solutions that vertically integrate into the MEV supply chain to help LPs protect their capital and become more profitable.
- Starting with the MEV-aware HOT AMM, Arrakis is innovating at the forefront of MEV recapture to push Ethereum DeFi forward.

- MEV is a problem for Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem and users are losing out as value gets leaked to Centralized Vertically-Integrated Market Makers across the MEV supply chain.
- As intents have gained pace, these actors have started to monopolize DeFi, leaving retail LPs with less revenue and more exposure to toxic flow.
- Arrakis plans to fix DeFi’s private market maker problem by vertically integrating into the MEV supply chain.
- The HOT AMM sits at the core of Arrakis. HOT is a MEV-aware DEX built to offer retail LPs toxic flow protection and better returns.

**How Retail Is Losing Out to the MEV Supply Chain**

MEV is one of Ethereum DeFi’s biggest challenges. As Ethereum has grown, sophisticated actors have infiltrated DeFi and leveraged complex strategies to extract value from the ecosystem.

These players profit from users during Ethereum’s block production process. Alongside builders and proposers, they form part of what’s known as [“the MEV supply chain.”](https://mirror.xyz/0x929fCf268A62e684221f1e39B8b6ddA2f0dA4AeC/_vHKmPZNKumuF15yp4RlCYPVnCzbS7ciIFyjY6wIpzg) **Retail users lose out to the MEV supply chain while searchers, builders, and proposers win**.
