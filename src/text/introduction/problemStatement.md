# Problem statement


## How retail is losing out to the MEV Supply Chain

MEV is one of Ethereum DeFi’s biggest challenges. As Ethereum has grown, sophisticated actors have infiltrated DeFi and leveraged complex strategies to extract value from the ecosystem.

These players profit from users during Ethereum’s block production process. Alongside builders and proposers, they form part of what’s known as [“the MEV supply chain.”](https://mirror.xyz/0x929fCf268A62e684221f1e39B8b6ddA2f0dA4AeC/_vHKmPZNKumuF15yp4RlCYPVnCzbS7ciIFyjY6wIpzg) **Retail users lose out to the MEV supply chain while searchers, builders, and proposers win**.

As of Oct 2024, Token Issuers, Retail DeFi, and other LPs have leaked $800M in MEV to poorly designed AMMs since the merge (Oct 2022).

CVMMs extract the majority of profits from onchain liquidity, leaving protocols and liquidity providers to fight for toxic order flow. They do so by:
1. By verticalizing across the MEV pipeline and creating monopolies on certain actions (e.g. block building) CVMMs are able to extract the lion's share of profits from onchain markets. 
2. CVMMs marginalize passive liquidity providers and endangers a permissionless and decentralized market structure for onchain trading.

## The rise of intents protocols

Uniswap X, CoW Swap and 1inch fusion account for more than 50% of all trades on Ethereum, as of October 2024.

As intents have gained pace, these actors have started to monopolize DeFi, leaving retail LPs with less revenue and more exposure to toxic flow.

## Where Arrakis fits in

Arrakis plans to fix DeFi’s private market maker problem by vertically integrating into the MEV supply chain.

Arrakis is focused on solving the MEV problem for LPs by building onchain solutions that vertically integrate into the MEV supply chain to help LPs protect their capital and become more profitable.

Furthermore, Centralized Vertically-Integrated Market Makers (CVMMs) are taking over DeFi but are unable to support the medium tail and long tail.
