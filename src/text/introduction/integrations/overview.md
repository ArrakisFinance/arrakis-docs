# Vault Integrations

Arrakis is focused on being a decentralized **onchain market making** solution, with a key feature of built-in MEV-Awareness / vertical integration into the MEV supply chain. Arrakis aims to give all token markets a seamless *next-generation onchain spot market liquidity provision experience*.

Here you can find more information on the integrations available on Arrakis Modular:

1. [HOT AMM](hotAMM/overview.md): HOT improves returns and maximizes capital efficiency for LPs, by internalizing MEV using an intent-based design. Designed in partnership with Valantis Labs, built on the [Valantis Modular DEX Framework](https://docs.valantis.xyz/). It is the first integration on Arrakis Modular and is powered by Arrakis's offchain market making infrastructure.

2. [Uniswap v4 Hook](uniV4Hook/overview.md): Coming soon...

## More on Arrakis Modular
The potential for integrations extends beyond single DEXs. While current use cases focus on modules which each integrate an individual DEX liquidity provision protocol, in theory, modules could become more complex, enabling integrations with multiple DEXs simultaneously or combining DEX and peripheral protocols like lending markets or options protocols for advanced functionality (hedging and delta-neutral strategies etc). The architecture of Arrakis Modular supports such future innovations.
