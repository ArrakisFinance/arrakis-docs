# Arrakis Pro

Arrakis Pro is the industry leading, non-custodial onchain liquidity management solution for token issuers (protocols and DAOs). Arrakis Pro powers protocol owned liquidity.

## Problem Statement

Uniswap v3 introduced the concept of concentrated liquidity AMM pools which enabled high capital efficiency, but were complex to manage.

Arrakis Pro supports token issuers by:

- Supporting token launches
- Bootstraping liquidity
- Ongoing inventory management

## Benefits

Protocols and DAOs can benefit from the following:

1. **Greater capital efficiency**: narrow price range with rebalancing to keep the price in the range.
2. **Minimum price impact**: increased liquidity depth leading to reduced downside price impact and market volatility.
3. **Return on capital**: facilitate more trading volumes whilst reducing toxic order flow.
4. **Active inventory management**: exposure the right amount of liquidity at the right time.

## Solution

Arrakis Pro simplifies the process of managing concentrated liquidity by automating liquidity provisioning and rebalancing, for any concentrated liquidity pool (including Uniswap v3, Uniswap v4 and Aerodrome). Arrakis Pro is powered by Arrakis's Offchain Market Making infrastructure.

Arrakis Pro was formerly known as PALM (built on top of Uniswap v3). With Arrakis Modular — the new and improved version of the Arrakis vaults — any DEX can be supported.
