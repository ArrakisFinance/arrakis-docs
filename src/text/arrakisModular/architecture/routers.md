# Routers

Arrakis Routers serve as crucial intermediaries that enhance security, improve user experience, and optimize gas usage. By providing a standardized entry point, routers can implement additional safety checks, simplify complex multi-step processes into single transactions, and enable gas-efficient operations through batching. Some of the implementations are the following:

- **Public Meta Vault Router**: streamlines the process of adding liquidity to ArrakisMetaVaultPublic instances. It integrates Permit2, a standardized token approval system, which enhances both security and user experience.
- **Private Meta Vault Router**: (coming soon)
