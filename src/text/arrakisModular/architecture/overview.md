# Architecture

At the heart of the Arrakis Modular system is the concept of Meta Vaults. These Meta Vaults enable users wishing to provide liquidity with two distinct assets to do so across any trading venueâ€”without the need to deploy or migrate funds to new vaults. Meta Vaults have the capability to whitelist various _modules_, essentially smart contracts that establish integration with liquidity-consuming dApps. This design ensures that as new DEXs emerge, liquidity provision becomes a matter of simply creating and whitelisting a new module compatible with the DEX, and then activating it.
