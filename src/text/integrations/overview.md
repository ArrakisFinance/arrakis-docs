# Integrations

Arrakis is focused on being a decentralized **onchain market making** solution, with a key feature of built-in MEV-Awareness / vertical integration into the MEV supply chain. Arrakis aims to give all token markets a seamless _next-generation onchain spot market liquidity provision experience_.

## More on Arrakis Modular

The potential for integrations extends beyond single DEXs. While current use cases focus on modules which each integrate an individual DEX liquidity provision protocol, in theory, modules could become more complex, enabling integrations with multiple DEXs simultaneously or combining DEX and peripheral protocols like lending markets or options protocols for advanced functionality (hedging and delta-neutral strategies etc). The architecture of Arrakis Modular supports such future innovations.
