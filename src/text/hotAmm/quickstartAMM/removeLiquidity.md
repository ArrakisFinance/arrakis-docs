# Remove liquidity

Here we explain how to remove liquidity from a Meta Vault that you own LP shares of.

1. Identify the Meta Vault address you want to exit, and verify it matches the address of your LP token. See [here](../deployments.md) for a full list of deployment addresses related to HOT AMM.
2. From now on, we use the Arrakis Public Router contract, defined here
   [`ArrakisPublicVaultRouter.sol`](../../../autogenerated/ArrakisPublicVaultRouter.sol/contract.ArrakisPublicVaultRouter.md)
3. Approve the LP token amount you want to convert in the underlying tokens by using the standard ERC20 `Approve`. The approval must be to `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter`.
4. Prepare the `RemoveLiquidityData` and call `ArrakisPublicVaultRouter::removeLiquidity`.
