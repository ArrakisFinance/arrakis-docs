# Quickstart AMM

In this section we describe the main actions that users can perform on the permissionless side of HOT AMM. We divide these actions into two sets:

- [Add Liquidty](addLiquidity.md) and [Remove Liquidity](removeLiquidity.md): For Liquidity Providers that want to fuel HOT AMM and earn from trading fees and incentives.
- [Swap](swap.md): For retail users and aggregators that desire to swap with low fees and up-to-date prices.
